As a conjugate method strength athlete, I want an app that will do the following so that I can track success (or deficiencies) in my program  

alpha  
 • converts kilos to lbs  
 • finds percentagesi (75% of this weight)  
 • calculates "accommodating resistance"  
 • interval timer  
 • includes Max Effort and Dynamic Effort "understanding"  
 • allow for selection of "accomidating resistance"  

v2  
 •  Suggests "accomidating resistance" (chains or bands)  
 • Output graph of progiress  
 • Predict patterns (could use ML or some pattern matching for this)  
   • suggest/point out plateus  
   • suggest when to push based on paleus  
   •  recommend deloading
